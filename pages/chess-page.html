        <h1>Chess</h1>

        <div class="page-text">Ahh, chess. Perhaps the ultimate game. I had always enjoyed playing the game, but my competitive career didn't extend past a few elementary school tournaments (and a participation trophy or two). 
        </div>
        
        <div class="page-text">It was only after college that I began learning more about the game, my appetite re-invigorated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agadmator's Chess Channel</a> on Youtube. His videos break down top-tier historical and modern games, explaining the players' decision-making and showing lines that look tempting but often lead to unexpected consequences. And he just seems like a nice dude. Would recommend.
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">After having spent a while in the 1500 Elo range on chess.com, mainly by merit of not blundering too often, I really started to accelerate my game. I reached 1700 (in 10-minute Rapid games) in March of 2022, then 1800 in November of the same year. After vacillating a bit around 1800, I decided to take a break from Rapid. 
        </div>

        <div class="gallery">

        </div>

        <div class="page-text">In addition to 10/0 Rapid, chess.com offers ratings for 3/0 Blitz and 1/0 Bullet (with a few similar formats contributing to each bucket). I set my sights on Bullet next - which ended up being a totally different game. A ton of games were won by whoever moved fastest, and it was only as I passed 1700 that strategy started to matter more than just blitzing out an opening. I got accustomed to it and climbed as my openings improved (Queen's Gambit, King's Gambit, Scandinavian, and a weird g6 response to 1. d5) - but I could never quite crack 1800, fizzling out at 1792.
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">This whole time, I had been grinding on my "main" account. I decided to try playing some Bullet on an alt, so that I wouldn't be so in my head about winning or losing. It turns out that that sense of freedom was exactly what I needed - and I soared past the 1700s, reaching a solid 1850 and then finally clearing 1900!
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="page-text">This was an achievement that I never thought possible. It's hard to put in perspective how much higher 1900 is than 1800. I would guess that a 1900-rated player would beat an 1800-rated player around 70% of the time, and a 1700-rated player maybe 90% of the time! One day, I hope to clear 2000 - but for now, I'm really proud of this achievement. (And taking a break from videogames, since I only got to this point by being literally addicted to playing Bullet).
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="page-text">Blitz ended up being harder to crack, for me at least. I found it too fast to think as deeply as I liked doing for Rapid games, but too slow to come back from sacking pieces in a reckless attack like I had grown used to in Bullet. There were definitely some cross-over effects, too; I had to focus on 1 time format at a time, lest ineffective habits from one format leaked over into my gameplay for another format. I ended up achieving a respectable 1700 on my main in 3/0 and 5/0 games.

        <div class="page-text">In 2023, I also picked up <a href="https://www.silmanjamespress.com/shop/chess/how-to-reassess-your-chess-4th-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Reassess Your Chess</a>, by Jeremy Silman (the 4th edition), off of a Reddit recommendation. Silman's philosophy of chess imbalances, focus on having a plan with each move, and sections on player psychology have all reframed the way in which I thought about the game - even as I continue to work my way through the book!

        <div class="page-text">"But Nick," you may be asking yourself, "You live in NYC - don't you have any stories of playing against the chess hustlers?" Fair enough. "All this online chess is well and good, but what about some stories from over the board?" All right, all right! 
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">I've actually only ever played against a hustler once, in Washington Square Park a while back. He was a pretty entertaining and engaging opponent, but his midgame play was a bit weak - maybe because he was freestyling about the game the entire time that we played! I certainly couldn't do both at the same time.
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">There was another time that I was in Cartagena, and happened across some older men playing chess in the street. I was impressed by their endgame position - a locked bishop, pawn, and rook endgame, with gaps covered not only by active pieces, but also the ghost threat of a breakthrough if a piece were to ever actually act on its claimed defensive potential against certain squares. I asked for a game (shout out my high school Spanish classes), and instantly got cooked by their best player. I asked for a rematch, and played kinda conservatively to hold it to a draw. In the final game, I was able to correctly analyze a sneaky gambited pawn in a claustrophobic midgame, seeing that it would eventually cost me a minor piece to capture it! From that point, I was able to push a queens-side attack and win the game.

        <div class="page-text">I've also enjoyed playing chess in hostels while traveling, at my local coffeeshop on open nights, and with a range of friends. I want to try playing at the <a href="https://www.chessforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess Forum</a> at some point.
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">Chess is such a beautiful, timeless game. I'm excited to think that I'll still be playing it when I'm an old man.
