        <div class="page-text"><a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duelingbook</a> is the home of online Yugioh (rip to Dueling Network). In 2019, after many years of playing Yugioh at various levels of competitiveness, I achieved rank 1 on the entire server, under the username (1). My friend David helped to grind the account out. My peak rating was higher than this, but I had to screenshot this moment of incredible syzygy (and a beautiful 79% winrate). This is how I earned the title of "King of Games" - the holy grail of Yugioh accomplishment.</div>

        <div class="page-text">My deck of choice at the time was Altergeist, for its flexibility going both 1st and 2nd, outplay potential through chains involving Personal Spoofing and Altergeist Silquitous, and my general love of Trap-based decks. Teching in Dinowrestler Pankratops and Monster Reborn let me play through otherwise lost positions, and keeping a lot of cards at 2 instead of the traditional 3 (like Spoofing) boosted consistency a lot. Going second, an Evenly Matched into an Altergeist Multifaker on resolution was enough to end many games on the spot.

        <div class="page-text"> I also saw success, particularly in the early stage of the climb, with a deck favored by both David and myself - True Draco. In addition to an excellent grind game, this deck was also unfairly strong going 1st due to cards like Card of Demise and The Monarchs Erupt. Our special tech? Strike of the Monarchs, an addition to the deck that caught a lot of opponents off guard. It could negate Evenly Matched or Twin Twisters, dodge on-field negation, and generally led to huge favorable swings of card economy when reolved. Teching in 3 copies, plus Pantheism of the Monarchs to search out Strike or Erupt at will, led to a lot of wins.

        <div class="page-text">I also streamed on <a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a> for a few weeks, routing Duelingbook spectators to my stream. I even cashed in on my fame for a whole $5, selling a custom decklist!</div>
